'Prevous' and 'Next' links are automatically inserted at the bottom of a page if `prev` and `next` variables are present in the frontmatter.

Any source files with a `.md` extension, like these demo pages, will be rendered out as HTML. The Markdown parser is custom and currently supports italics, bold, links, headers, unordered lists, inline code, horizontal rules, code blocks, and paragraphs (the Markdown support has evolved to fit existing needs and so is idiosyncratic or limited in some of its implementations).
